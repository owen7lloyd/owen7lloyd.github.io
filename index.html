          <p>My name is Owen.</p>
          <p>
            I am a rising senior studying mathematics and data science at the
            <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">Pennsylvania State University</a> (we
            are!) in the
            <a href="https://www.shc.psu.edu/">Schreyer Honors College</a>. This
            summer, I'm interning at
            <a href="https://disneyanimation.com/"
              >Walt Disney Animation Studios</a
            >
            on their production analytics team.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a rising senior at Penn State, I've enjoyed working as a teaching
            assistant for Math 484 and being actively part of Alpha Kappa Psi,
            Schreyer Consulting Group, and Travel Club Tennis and Pickleball on
            campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            In high school I was a highly competitive tennis player, winning the
            district doubles championship all four years and competing in
            sectional and national tournaments organized by USTA. During my
            junior year I began teaching junior tennis clinics and lessons at
            the Penn State Tennis Center, giving me the opportunity to work with
            kids of a wide variety of ages.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have previously worked as a Data Science intern at Analog Devices
            on the OtoSenseAI team and as a Data Analytics intern at Croptix. I
            am currently working as a Production Analytics intern at Walt Disney
            Animation Studios.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am fascinated by sports and elite athletes' ability to rise to any
            occassion. I sometimes spend a little too much time considering
            myself an expert film critic, listening to podcasts and solving
            Rubik's cubes.
