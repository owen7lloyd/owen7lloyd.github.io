          <p>My name is Owen.</p>
          <p>
            I am a rising senior studying mathematics and data science at the
            <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">Pennsylvania State University</a> (we
            are!) in the
            <a href="https://www.shc.psu.edu/">Schreyer Honors College</a>. This
            summer, I'm interning at
            <a href="https://disneyanimation.com/"
              >Walt Disney Animation Studios</a
            >
            on their production analytics team.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a rising senior at Penn State, I've enjoyed working as a teaching
            assistant for Math 484 and being actively part of Alpha Kappa Psi,
            Schreyer Consulting Group, and Travel Club Tennis and Pickleball on
            campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            In high school I was a highly competitive tennis player, winning the
            district doubles championship all four years and competing in
            sectional and national tournaments organized by USTA. During my
            junior year I began teaching junior tennis clinics and lessons at
            the Penn State Tennis Center, giving me the opportunity to work with
            kids of a wide variety of ages.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have previously worked as a Data Science intern at Analog Devices
            on the OtoSenseAI team and as a Data Analytics intern at Croptix. I
            am currently working as a Production Analytics intern at Walt Disney
            Animation Studios.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am fascinated by sports and elite athletes' ability to rise to any
            occassion. I sometimes spend a little too much time considering
            myself an expert film critic, listening to podcasts and solving
            Rubik's cubes.

                As a part of my coursework in the Schreyer Honors College, I am
                writing an undergraduate honors thesis. The working title of my
                thesis is: Stochastic Calculus of Functions with Random Times. I
                will be working with Dr. Andrew Belmonte over the next year to
                develop this original work.

                This calendar year I have served on the Executive Board of my
                co-ed professional business fraternity. As a member of the
                executive board, I help to develop the professional skills of
                our inductee class each semester as well as work to find and
                support opportunities for our fraternity to give back to the
                local community. Specifically as the VP of Finance, I oversee
                the planning and allocation of our fraternity budget, keeping
                track of our expenses and staying in constant communication with
                our national office.

                While interning with Croptix, I applied machine learning
                techniques to develop models to classify HLB disease in orange
                and lemon crops using the light spectrum data of citrus leaves.
                In conjunction with machine learning models, I also developed an
                algorithm to match groups of leaf measurements to ground truth
                tree locations based on GPS data, increasing the efficiency and
                accuracy of generating reports for our customers.

                While interning with Analog devices, I designed a machine
                learning pipeline for fault detection in Renault manufacturing
                and vehicles based on audio data, leveraging spectral
                projectors, centroid smoothing models, and random forests to
                build classification models and visualization tools. To aid with
                the Renault pipeline, I also helped to develop new
                smart-chunking systems to allow for only relevant audio to be
                passed to audio classificaiton pipelines.

                While part of CTP, I learned techniques and strategies to
                approach consulting solutions and problems. I worked as a part

                mentors regarding strategy, implementation, and finances in four
                different real world bussiness contexts.
