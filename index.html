            customer-facing engineer, assisting customers with technical
            questions related to our control design and signal processing

                As a member of the Engineering Development Group at MathWorks, I
                spend my time working both as a customer-facing engineer
                providing technical support to customers, and as a software
                engineer completing development projects with various product
                teams.
              </p>
              Below are some of the development projects I have worked on so
              far:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Implemented several enhancements for internal React-based
                  Table and TreeTable widgets:
                  <ul style="list-style: circle">
                    <li>
                      Added support for rendering table cells in three new
                      numeric formats: binary, hexadecimal, and complex.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Added support for editing table cells in various numeric
                      formats: decimal, scientific, binary, hexadecimal, and
                      complex.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Addressed accessibility concerns to ensure focus-related
                      events were properly emitted after keyboard interactions.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Investigated the feasibility of supporting non-linear
                  regression functions in the
                  <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html"
                    >Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox</a
                  >
                  for automatic C++ code generation through our
                  <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-coder.html"
                    >Coder products</a
                  >. Implemented internal prototype of

                  that supports code generation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Created a demo for the Finance Application Engineering team to
                  present to customers, demonstrating new features in the
                  <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/finance.html"

                  Toolboxes. You can find the blog post I wrote for this demo in

              <p></p>
              <p>
                Along with the development work described above, I also work as
                a customer-facing engineer, providing technical support to
                customers, specifically those using our control design
                automation and signal processing products. Addressing various
                technical issues through email and phone communication with
                customers has greatly increased my knowledge of Simulink and its
                suite of associated products. I have also worked with newer
                members of the EDG program, coaching them through their first
                few phone call sessions as they get comfortable providing
                support to customers in real-time.

                While interning with Walt Disney Animation Studios, I worked on

                for the animation department to apply a machine learning model

                for the consideration of additional constraints, specifically
                project priorities and short-term hiring caps. These
                optimizations led to reductions of studio time costs of up to
                $1MM.

                As a part of my coursework in the Schreyer Honors College, I had
                the opportunity to write an undergraduate honors thesis. In my
                thesis, I explored the extension of the theory of calculus to
                the case of random independent variables, aiming to find a
                consistent way to extend our conception of functional dependence
                to domains which include randomness. I worked with

                to develop this original work.

                Semester-long project from Data Science 340W (Applied Data
                Sciences). We explored the application of state-of-the art
                practices in sentiment analysis applied to sarcasm detection in
                American sitcoms. We were able to outperform standard text-based
                sarcasm detection systems through the addition of audio and
                visual modalities. Collaboration with Garrett Parrish and
                Anastasia Vopelius.
